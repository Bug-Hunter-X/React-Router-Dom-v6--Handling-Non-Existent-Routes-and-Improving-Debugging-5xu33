This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6: navigating to non-existent routes. The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using the `useLocation` hook and a custom error component. The problem is that React Router doesn't explicitly tell you when a route is invalid, leading to difficult debugging. The solution adds explicit error handling to improve the developer experience.
