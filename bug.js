In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist.  This often leads to unexpected behavior, or the application crashing silently without clear error messages.  For instance, if you have a route defined for `/home` but the user attempts to access `/Home` (case sensitivity), or a non-existent route `/invalid`, the application might simply render nothing or throw a cryptic error within the React component tree.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the default behavior for unknown routes doesn't necessarily offer clear debugging signals.
